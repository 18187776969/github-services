When enabled this will let the Docker Hub know when you have made changes to
your repository. The Docker Hub will then pull down your repository and build
your Dockerfile to create a Docker repository and push it onto the Docker Hub
so that it is available for others to download. When you commit changes to your
git Repo the Docker Hub will keep the Docker Repository up to date.

In order for this to work correctly, you should have the following:

1. A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com "Docker Hub") Account, that is linked to your GitHub account.
2. A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/ "Dockerfile") in your project directory.
