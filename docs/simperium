This service creates a Simperium object for hook events in a bucket named
for the event type.

Supported events are currently:
'push', 'issues', 'issue_comment', 'commit_comment', 'pull_request',
'pull_request_review_comment', 'watch', 'fork', 'fork_apply',
'member', 'public', 'team_add', 'status'

More details on Github events: http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/

Simperium IDs:
'push' - Each object ID will be the SHA of the commit (eg. '06f63b43050935962f84fe54473a7c5de7977325')
all others - Each object ID will be a Unix timestamp (eg. '1367458703')
