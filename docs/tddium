Install Notes
-------------

If you've connected your GitHub account with Tddium, your repos will be automatically set up with this hook.

If you don't want to connect your Github account, or you want to give Tddium GitHub repo privileges, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Tddium dashboard
2. Open the Configuration page for this repo and find the 'CI Setup' section
3. Copy the 32-character hex value listed under 'CI Token'
4. Paste the token above.
5. Install Tddium's repo-specific public key into this repo's deploy keys.  

Whenever you push, delete a branch, open or update a pull request, Tddium will do the right thing, automatically.
