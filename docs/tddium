1. Go to your Tddium dashboard
2. Open the Configuration page for this repo and find the 'CI Setup' section
3. Copy the 32-character hex value listed under 'CI Token'
4. Paste the token above.
5. Install Tddium's repo-specific public key into this repo's deploy keys.

----------------

Tddium monitors all events on your repo, but it currently only acts on:

- push
- create a branch
- delete a branch
- open, close, synchronize pull requests
