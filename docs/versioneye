VersionEye is a notification system for software libraries. It notifies you about out-dated dependencies in your repository. Works currently for Ruby (Bundler), Python (Pypi), Node.JS (NPM), Java (Maven, Gradle), PHP (Composer) and Clojure (Lein). Integration for CocoaPods and Bower is on the way.

This service hook will inform VersionEye every time you push to GitHub. On every push VersionEye will re parse your project file.
